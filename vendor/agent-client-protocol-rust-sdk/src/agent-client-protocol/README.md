# agent-client-protocol

Core protocol types and traits for the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/).

ACP is a protocol for communication between AI agents and their clients (IDEs, CLIs, etc.),
enabling features like tool use, permission requests, and streaming responses.

## What can you build with this crate?

- **Clients** that talk to ACP agents (like building your own Claude Code interface)
- **Proxies** that add capabilities to existing agents (like adding custom tools via MCP)
- **Agents** that respond to prompts with AI-powered responses

## Quick Start: Connecting to an Agent

The most common use case is connecting to an existing ACP agent as a client.
This quick start uses stable protocol v1:

```rust,no_run
use agent_client_protocol::{AcpAgent, Client, Result};
use agent_client_protocol::schema::{ProtocolVersion, v1::InitializeRequest};

# async fn connect() -> Result<()> {
let agent = AcpAgent::from_args(["my-agent"])?;
Client.builder()
    .name("my-client")
    .connect_with(agent, async |cx| {
        // Initialize the connection
        cx.send_request(InitializeRequest::new(ProtocolVersion::V1))
            .block_task()
            .await?;

        Ok(())
    })
    .await
# }
```

Draft protocol v2 is opt-in through `unstable_protocol_v2`. `Client.v2()`,
`Agent.v2()`, and `Proxy.v2()` callbacks receive a version-typed
`V2ConnectionTo` with
high-level, command-only session helpers because prompt acceptance and inbound
traffic are independent. Session updates and interactive requests use typed
connection handlers. See [Protocol V2](https://agentclientprotocol.github.io/rust-sdk/protocol-v2.html#high-level-v2-sessions).
`Proxy.builder()` remains the stable v1 entry point; raw routing infrastructure
that selects and validates the version itself can use
`Proxy.builder().without_acp_version_guard()`.

## MCP Server Attachment

The runtime-agnostic `mcp_server` module can build and directly serve standalone
MCP servers without enabling an ACP schema extension. Attaching one to ACP with
the `with_mcp_server` builder methods requires `unstable_mcp_over_acp`.
Attached servers are advertised with native `McpServer::Acp` declarations and
communicate through `mcp/connect`, `mcp/message`, and `mcp/disconnect`. Use
`agent-client-protocol-polyfill` immediately before an HTTP-capable agent.
Stable protocol v1 supports per-session and global proxy attachment. Draft
protocol v2 supports both scopes when both unstable features are enabled:
`Proxy.v2().with_mcp_server(...)` injects a global server into supported setup
requests, and `V2SessionBuilder::with_mcp_server(...)` attaches one to a single
`session/new`. Successful attachments remain active for the connection
lifetime. A v2 proxy can forward setup with
`V2SessionBuilder::on_proxy_session_start`; updates and interactive requests
remain independent connection traffic.
