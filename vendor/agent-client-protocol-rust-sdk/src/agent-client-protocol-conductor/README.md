# agent-client-protocol-conductor

Binary for orchestrating [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) proxy chains.

## What is the conductor?

The conductor is a tool that manages proxy chains — it spawns proxy components and the base agent, then routes messages between them. From the editor's perspective, the conductor appears as a single ACP agent.

```
Editor ← stdio → Conductor → Proxy 1 → Proxy 2 → Agent
```

## Usage

### Agent Mode

Orchestrate a chain of proxies in front of an agent:

```bash
# Chain format: proxy1 proxy2 ... agent
agent-client-protocol-conductor agent "python proxy1.py" "python proxy2.py" "python base-agent.py"
```

The conductor:

1. Spawns each component as a subprocess
2. Connects them in a chain
3. Presents as a single agent on stdin/stdout
4. Manages the lifecycle of all processes

## How It Works

**Component Communication:**

- Editor talks to conductor via stdio
- Conductor uses the `_proxy/successor` envelope to route messages
- Each proxy can intercept, transform, or forward messages
- Final agent receives standard ACP messages

**Process Management:**

- All components are spawned as child processes
- When conductor exits, all children are terminated
- Errors in any component bring down the entire chain

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release -p agent-client-protocol-conductor

# Include draft ACP v2 proxy initialization
cargo build --release -p agent-client-protocol-conductor --features unstable_protocol_v2
```

Binary will be at `target/release/agent-client-protocol-conductor`.
