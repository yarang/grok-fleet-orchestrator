# MCP-over-ACP Compatibility Bridge

`agent-client-protocol-polyfill::mcp_over_acp::McpOverAcpPolyfill` adapts the
native ACP MCP transport for a final agent that accepts HTTP MCP
servers. MCP adaptation is explicit and is not built into the conductor.

The component-facing side of the bridge always uses the opt-in native protocol:

- Servers are declared as `McpServer::Acp` with a `serverId`.
- Connections use `mcp/connect`, `mcp/message`, and `mcp/disconnect`.
- `mcp/disconnect` is a request with a response.

The SDK-local underscore-prefixed method family and HTTP declarations with a
special URL scheme have been retired. The polyfill now translates native
declarations to real localhost HTTP URLs only at
the compatibility boundary.

Native MCP-over-ACP requires the core SDK's `unstable_mcp_over_acp` feature. The
polyfill enables that feature on its core dependency, so applications using the
polyfill receive it through Cargo feature unification.

The polyfill supports stable protocol v1 by default. To place it in a draft-v2
conductor chain, enable `unstable_protocol_v2` on both the conductor and
polyfill dependencies:

```toml
agent-client-protocol-conductor = { version = "...", features = ["unstable_protocol_v2"] }
agent-client-protocol-polyfill = { version = "...", features = ["unstable_protocol_v2"] }
```

The feature makes this concrete compatibility proxy recognize v2
initialization, capability, session setup, and `mcp/*` wire types. It does not
add high-level v2 global MCP attachment or proxy-session helpers to the core
SDK; those remain v1-only.

## Placement

Insert the polyfill immediately before the final agent that lacks native
MCP-over-ACP support:

```rust,ignore
use agent_client_protocol_conductor::{ConductorImpl, ProxiesAndAgent};
use agent_client_protocol_polyfill::mcp_over_acp::McpOverAcpPolyfill;

let components = ProxiesAndAgent::new(agent)
    .proxy(application_proxy)
    .proxy(McpOverAcpPolyfill::http());

ConductorImpl::new_agent("conductor", components)
    .run(upstream_transport)
    .await?;
```

For v1, the application proxy can attach a high-level
`agent_client_protocol::mcp_server::McpServer`. The SDK advertises it in session
setup requests as `McpServer::Acp`; callers do not need to construct a transport
placeholder themselves. In a v2 chain, a version-aware proxy currently supplies
the `schema::v2::McpServer::Acp` declaration directly because the high-level
global proxy attachment helpers remain v1-only.

During initialization, the polyfill forwards the request to its successor. When
the successor advertises HTTP MCP support, the polyfill advertises native ACP
MCP support in the response seen upstream:

- v1 sets `agentCapabilities.mcpCapabilities.acp` to `true`.
- v2 adds the `capabilities.session.mcp.acp` marker.

In this chain position that capability means the chain can consume native
MCP-over-ACP declarations through the adapter; it does not imply that the final
agent implements the transport itself.

If the successor already advertises native ACP MCP support, the polyfill leaves
the capability, declarations, and `mcp/message` traffic unchanged. If it
supports neither native nor HTTP MCP, the polyfill does not advertise ACP MCP
support and rejects any native declaration that is nevertheless supplied.

## Transformation

For each schema-selected `McpServer::Acp` entry in a session setup request, the
polyfill:

1. Creates or reuses a connection-scoped localhost bridge endpoint for the
   `serverId` and replaces the declaration with the HTTP transport for the
   final agent.
2. Retains the native `serverId` so connections can be routed back to the
   component that provided the server.
3. Opens the endpoint's native connection by sending `mcp/connect` with that
   server ID toward the provider.
4. Relays requests and notifications through `mcp/message`, using the returned
   `connectionId` for that active MCP connection.
5. Sends an `mcp/disconnect` request when the local transport closes and removes
   the connection from the bridge.

Enable the polyfill crate's `unstable_session_fork` feature when adapting fork
requests. Stable v1 setup includes `session/new`, `session/load`, and
`session/resume`; draft v2 includes `session/new` and `session/resume`. Both
versions include `session/fork` when `unstable_session_fork` is enabled.

Declarations using another transport are left unchanged, including extension
transports represented by v2's `McpServer::Other`.

Endpoints are cached by `serverId` across session setup requests on the ACP
connection. The output declaration is rebuilt for each occurrence, preserving
that occurrence's `name`, `_meta`, and other unmodified extension fields even
when its endpoint is reused.

The native wire envelopes are documented in the [SDK Protocol
Reference](./protocol.md#native-mcp-over-acp).

## HTTP Mode

`McpOverAcpPolyfill::http()` is the default compatibility shape. It replaces
the native declaration with an HTTP MCP URL at `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`. The
embedded server accepts MCP POST requests and an SSE GET stream at `/`, retaining
JSON-RPC batch frames and correlating each POST with its response.

```rust,ignore
let bridge = McpOverAcpPolyfill::http();
```

The listener is bound only on loopback and uses an ephemeral port. It does not
implement resumable SSE event IDs.

## Lifecycle and Failure Behavior

Each bridge endpoint receives a unique `connectionId` from `mcp/connect`. The
polyfill keeps a connection map until the endpoint's transport task closes,
then removes the entry, sends `mcp/disconnect`, and observes its response.
Request failures use the corresponding request's error path; notifications are
never answered with synthetic errors.

A reverse `mcp/message` request for an unknown `connectionId` receives
`Invalid params`. A reverse notification for an unknown connection is ignored,
as required for JSON-RPC notifications.

The polyfill does not infer or store ACP session IDs. Association is carried by
the declared `serverId` and the resulting active `connectionId`.
