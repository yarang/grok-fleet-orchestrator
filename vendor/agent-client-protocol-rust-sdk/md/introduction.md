# Agent Client Protocol Rust SDK

This repository contains the Rust SDK for the [Agent-Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/).

## For Users

**If you want to build something with these crates**, see the rustdoc:

- **[`agent-client-protocol`](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol)** - Core SDK for building clients, agents, and proxies
- **[`agent-client-protocol-cookbook`](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol-cookbook)** - Practical patterns and examples
- **[`agent-client-protocol-conductor`](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol-conductor)** - Running proxy chains

The `agent-client-protocol` crate includes a [`concepts`](https://docs.rs/agent-client-protocol/latest/agent_client_protocol/concepts/) module that explains how connections, sessions, callbacks, and message ordering work.

## For Maintainers and Agents

**This book** documents the design and architecture for people working on the codebase itself.
